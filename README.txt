Waldgarten Ottenacker â€” Deployment package
------------------------------------------

Files:
- index.html         (the website)
- README.txt         (this file)

STATUS:
- This package contains the static HTML/CSS homepage created for Waldgarten Ottenacker.
- The site is NOT yet hosted publicly. To make it accessible on the web you must upload these files to a hosting service.

QUICK HOSTING OPTIONS (choose one):

1) GitHub Pages (free, simple)
   - Create a GitHub account and a new repository (e.g. 'waldgarten-ottenacker').
   - Upload index.html to the repository root.
   - In repository settings -> Pages, set the branch to 'main' and folder to '/'.
   - The site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/ or, for user pages, https://<your-username>.github.io/

2) Netlify (drag & drop or git-connected, free tier)
   - Create a Netlify account.
   - From the Sites dashboard: drag-and-drop this folder (unzipped) into Sites -> 'Drag & drop your site output folder here'.
   - Or connect your GitHub repo and Netlify will deploy automatically.
   - Netlify provides an easy admin interface and team access.

3) Vercel (good for static and React sites)
   - Create a Vercel account and connect your GitHub repo or drag & drop the site folder.
   - Vercel will provide a URL and easy redeploys on push.

4) Traditional web host with FTP/SFTP
   - Use any hosting provider (Hostinger, Ionos, Hetzner, etc.).
   - Upload index.html to the public_html (or www) folder via FTP/SFTP.
   - Provide FTP credentials to people who should edit the site.

EDITING / MAINTENANCE
- Simple edits: open index.html in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code), change text or image links, save and re-upload.
- Replace gallery placeholders (LINK_ZUM_BILD_1) with direct image URLs.
  For Google Drive, convert sharing link to direct image link:
    - Sharing link looks like: https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing
    - Direct link format: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID

GIVE OTHERS ACCESS
- GitHub: add collaborators in repository Settings -> Manage Access.
- Netlify/Vercel: invite team members (email) and assign roles.
- FTP: create separate FTP users on your hosting control panel.

SECURITY / LEGAL NOTES
- If you publish photos of children, ensure you have written consent from parents for online use.
- Use secure passwords and enable 2FA on accounts (GitHub, Netlify).
